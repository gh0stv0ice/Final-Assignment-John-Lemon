## 🛠️ Modifications
I contributed a minor modification to the game mechanics:  
- Updated the Ghosts/enemies movement so they move **randomly** instead of just front and back.  
- This change makes the gameplay more **challenging** and **fun**.

---

## ⚡ Biggest Challenge
- The main difficulty was downloading the correct Unity version.  
- My computer isn’t very strong for Unity, which made setup a bit tricky.  
- Other than that, no major challenges were encountered.

## ✅ Project Status
- I consider this assignment **officially complete**.  
- No further work will be done on this project.
